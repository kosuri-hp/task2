        HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it
        annotates text to define how it is structured and displayed by web
        browsers.

    <h2 id="two">Features of HTML</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>It is easy to learn and easy to use.</li>
      <li>It is platform-independent.</li>
      <li>Images, videos, and audio can be added to a web page.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2 id="three">HTML Element and HTML Tag</h2>
    <p>
      HTML Element and HTML Tags are related but distinct. An HTML element is
      the complete structure, including the opening tag, content (if any), and
      the closing tag (if applicable).
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, A tag is the actual keyword or name enclosed in angle
      brackets (&lt &gt) that tells the browser what kind of content to expect.
    </p>

    <h2>HTML Page Structure</h2>
    <p>
      The basic structure of an HTML page is shown below. It contains the
      essential building-block elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head,
      title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.
    </p>
    <img src="images/image2.png" />
    <ul>
      <li><a href="">&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</a>- This is the document type declaration, not a tag. It declares that the
        document is an HTML5 document.</li></a>
     
        <li><a href="">&ltHead&gt</a>- This is the document type declaration, not a tag. It declares that the
            document is an HTML5 document.
        <ul>
            <li><a href="">&lttitle&gt</a>:Defines the title displayed on the browser tab.</li>
            <li><a href="">&ltmeta&gt</a>:Defines the title displayed on the browser tab.</li>
            <li><a href="">&ltlink&gt</a>:Defines the title displayed on the browser tab.</li>
       
        </ul></li></a>
        <li><a href="">&ltTitle&gt</a>- This is the document type declaration, not a tag. It declares that the
            document is an HTML5 document.</li></a>
            <li><a href="">&ltP&gt</a>-  The tag represents a paragraph of text.</li></a>
            <li><a href="">&ltbody&gt</a>- The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front end.</li></a>

    </ul>
    <p>An HTML document can be created using an HTML text editor. Save the text file using the “.html” or “.htm” extension. Once saved as an HTML document, the file can be opened as a webpage in the browser.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> Basic/built-in text editors are Notepad (Windows) and TextEdit (MacOS). Other advanced text editors include Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, Froala, etc.</p>
<h2>Web Browsers</h2> 
<p>Unlike other programming languages, HTML does not show output on the compiler.<br> <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-browser-a-complete-overview/">Web browsers</a> show the results of an HTML code.</p>
<p>It reads HTML files and determines how to show content with the help of HTML tags. Any web browser (Google, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, etc) can be used to open a . HTML file and view the results.</p>

<h2>HTML History</h2>

    HTML was initially created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a way to share and structure documents on the web.
    
    The first-ever version was HTML 1.0, a basic and limited version. However, the first standardized version, HTML 2.0, was published in 1995, laying the foundation for web development as we know it today</p>
